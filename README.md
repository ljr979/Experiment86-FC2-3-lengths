# Experiment86-FC2-3-lengths
This aims to see if when monitoring THE SAME FIBRILS over a 4h period, in the presence of B1, A8, 110, and ATP, they get shorter (disaggregate). 



In this experiment, we use the lengths of fibrils from FC2-1 where we  flowed in hsp110 onto fibrils bound by JB1 and A8 already, but also monitoring the same fibrils over time, every hour during which there was additional ATP and chaperones flowed into the flow cell.
